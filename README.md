HMD-Calibration Toolbox for MATLAB(R)
===============

A correct spatial registration of Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays (OST-HMD) w.r.t. a userâ€™s eye(s) is an essential problem for any AR application using the such HMDs.

This toolbox aims to provide core functionalities of the OST-HMD calibration 
including eye localization-based methods and Direct Linear Transform,
and to share the evaluation scheme we used for our experiments. 

## How to use it:
Requirements: MATLAB (with Statistics Toolbox)

At the root directory of this reporisory on your matlab console, just type,
```matlab
>> main
```
then you will see some calibration results like the following:

If you want to use the core functionality of this tool box for your own calibration, 
please consult the following function files:
```matlab
>> % Functions that give you 3x4 projection matrix
>>
>> % Eye position-based calibration (Full/Recycle Setups)
>> % for Interaction-free Display CAlibration (INDICA) method.
>> P = INDICA_Full   (R_WS, R_WT, t_WT, t_ET, t_WS, ax, ay, w, h);
>> P = INDICA_Recycle(R_WS, R_WT, t_WT, t_ET, t_WS_z, K_E0, t_WE0);
>>
>> % A basic Direct Linear Transform for SPAAM
>> P = DLT(uv,xyz); 
```
The figure below visualizes spatial relationship of each input arguments for INDICA:

Our code is tested on MATLAB(R) version 2013b, and might require some toolboxes.

Note that the evalation scheme in the code is different from the one used in the above paper.
Following the change, a new dataset was acquired and is included in this repository.
